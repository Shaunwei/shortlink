URL Shortener Challenge
=======================

Implement a simple URL shortening service in Python as efficiently as
possible.  Your URL shortener should include the following:

   * An endpoint that receives a URL and returns a new shortened URL
   * An endpoint to retrieve the last 100 shortened URLs
   * An endpoint to retrieve the top 10 most popular shortened domains in the past month
   * An endpoint to retrieve the number of times a shortened URL has
     been visited.
